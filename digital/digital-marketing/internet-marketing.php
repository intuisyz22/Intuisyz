        <p>The popularity of innovative designs can be attributed to the power of creativity. The intention of every website is to engage the 
          incoming traffic as long as possible. Creative designs are often the best means to establish this. These designs differ from
           conventional patterns and are visual treats to bored eyes.</p>

          <p>Who are your target customers? How do you direct them to you? If they are Youtube viewers, start making your viral
             Youtube videosâ€¦ If they are professionals, explore them on LinkedIn.Be quick in identifying needy customers and 
             reaching out to them to drive them home to your website. Rewarding marketing tools are those that reach the right
