            among your potential customers.</p>

             your business for both desktops and mobile devices.</p>

          <h3>SHORTCUT TO RANKING HIGH IN MOBILE SEARCH RESULTS</h3>
          <p>By providing a single and dynamic version of your website to both desktop and mobile visitors, you make it easier 
            for search engines to understand and serve your content to an increasing number of users. If responsive, search engines
             prefer your website over others that are not, and therefore index you first. This helps in directing a large number of 
             customers to your website without additional effort from your part.</p>
